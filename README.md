# anything

Query engine capable of querying for anything and nothing.

Anything provides the `any` binary, which is a small flexible program intended
to do calculations and query for numerical facts. Among other things it can do:

* Unit conversions `3floz to dl` (this is mostly why I use this).
* Fact queries `population finland / population world`.
* Basic math `100l / round(population finland)`.
* Unit-aware calculations `3N / 10kg` gives us `0.3 m/sÂ²`.

You can thing of `any` is a much simpler and local wolfram engine. Which I'm
hoping to extend it as I go along.
